I was also a data scientist at NREL while I studied applied math at the Colorado School of Mines.\nWhile the posts in this blog are my own, I’ve also written for Google, RStudio, NREL, and Mines. You can view my research profile here where I’ve accidentally gotten an h-index of 4! I’ve also written extensively about environment management in R.\nIf you are looking for videos or pretty versions of talks, those live here.\nThis site is built using the R package distill and hosted by Netlify.\n\n\n\n",
