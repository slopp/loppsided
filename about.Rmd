My name is Sean Lopp. I post about a wide range of topics including: data science, open source software, product management, and bikes.

I currently lead product teams at RStudio, a B corporation that supports open source software for data science. I was previously an ML engineer, a sales rep, and a data scientist at NREL. I studied applied math at the Colorado School of Mines. \

While the posts in this blog **are my own**, I've also written for RStudio, NREL, and Mines. You can view my [research profile here](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Sean-Lopp/8719760) where I've accidentally gotten an h-index of 4! I've also written extensively about [environment management](https://environments.rstudio.com) in R.
